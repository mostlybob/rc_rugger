# First go
Being my first repo, my expectations are modest. The main reason for starting this repo is to get some practice with GitHub. The nominal, although secondary reason is to have a place to put ideas for presentations at future Ruby user group meetings. I plan to use this as a bit of a test bed for messing around with GitHub and learning about keeping a repo. I don't have code ideas at this point, so the immediate goal is to learn a bit of markdown in the process.
